<description>&lt;div class=&#039;snap_preview&#039;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;First off, I have been an &quot;executive&quot; in IT security sales and marketing since the 1900&#039;s. No, I am not posting my real name or what company I work for. I am proud to say that I enjoy what I do and truly believe in the product I market and sell. Otherwise, I would be doing something else. I&#039;ve made the switch before and would make it again.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Time after time - as I see the deception and incompetence in IT security hardware and software sales (and use) - I have sought a creative way to blow off steam. So, think of this blog as 1) a pressure release valve for me and 2) a way to help professional IT users, buyers, and enthusiasts understand what goes on behind the scenes.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Now, it won&#039;t always be pretty. In fact, I may point a finger or two - sometimes I&#039;ll use the middle one - to some in the &quot;user base&quot; and sometimes those who help &quot;manage&quot; those in the user base. It might hurt, but I assure you it is the truth.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&quot;But you&#039;re one of them! And, you&#039;re using some sort of Jedi mind trick on me,&quot; the reader suddenly exclaims. I can understand that perspective . . . But think about it: I position and spin things during the day at my real job. This is not intended as a forum to encourage attacks on specific, competing vendors or products. I do that elsewhere. I have no desire to do that in my blogtherapy sessions &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; what I share with you will be limited to legitimate complaints about the more general state of IT security affairs.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;You&#039;ll be entertained and will likely have at least one epiphanous moment. I promise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;div class=&#039;snap_preview&#039;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;wow first time i added a title to my post. just feels right haha..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;hmmm i am officially an ex-ma&amp;#8217;am now. since i&amp;#8217;m so free (actually i&amp;#8217;m unwilling to go do work) i shall blog a super loooooong post from POP onwards!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;changing u in the locker toilet was so cool! cos the whole squad was changing there and it feels weird cos it has never happened since like we became NCOs.. it was very 热闹 and crowded haha.. anw i changed faster and i went up with sijia first and we went to write attendance book. its the last time! i took the last attendance for our squad! &lt;img src=&#039;http://s.wordpress.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif&#039; alt=&#039;:D&#039; class=&#039;wp-smiley&#039; /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;went to take last attendance for 41 too *感伤* then wanted to check u but scared later sqdms complain that we never let them check u for the last time.. then went to take photos with TOs!! mr ho seriously looks better in NP u haha and i&amp;#8217;m so jealous that he has HUGE SPF-NPCC and NYAA to show off! then before we knew it 40 suddenly went to get miss yap liao then we had to start the parade with no ex-ma&amp;#8217;ams! it was super weird i tell you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i guess the parade was ok lah (: mr han said his 5page looooong script (OMG). my boots were burning liao lor. ok i guess the whole unit one also. and my angkat was ok haha (:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;did our squad cheers!!! we didn&amp;#8217;t do rock your boat though. it will remain a secret from the rest of the unit forever&amp;#8230;.. then we went to keep rifles. didnt want to waste time running all over the school hiding from sqdms cos jieqi had to go get her jap buddy but then when we saluted cadets i forgot who gave us a puzzle piece!!! peiting and clarissa and shuning cheated us and didnt give us!! so we had to run back to their staircase and salute them and go and 讨 from them again -_____-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;when to conference room and almost sat on the &amp;#8220;39&amp;#8243; thingy 40 made. 40&amp;#8217;s emceeing was like lame dao bao man. but anw. 38 ma&amp;#8217;ams came! then we saw 37 ma&amp;#8217;ams and 36 ma&amp;#8217;ams too. very 遗憾 cos didnt get to talk to 37 ma&amp;#8217;ams cos they left early! ): then had song dedication where 36 ma&amp;#8217;ams welcomed us into alumni (feels super weird) and our NCOs said other stuff. and 40 showed the photo montage OMG. i sincerely hope that no one noticed deborah&amp;#8217;s hair except for us haha. then we saw all our old photos and 回想起 the happy times we had with ma&amp;#8217;ams. then after a while they started performance!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;42 are hilarious lor jiexi was really like some lao da liddat haha.. huipeng looked like she was going to die of embaressment and break down any moment haha.. their nursery rhyme thingy i bet was influenced by their NCOs lor ahem ahem. reminds us of our down by the bay which stephanie ma&amp;#8217;am mentioned. but it was fun while doing it lah (: squadmate kissing a snake!! haha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;then 41 did alot of songs!! they went to remix it leh so er duno how to describe. put in alot of effort? ok nvm. my lack of vocab -____- mrhan was so random to ask them to form the NP choir halfway -_____- anw 41 never provide earplug for us lor still want us to put in haha.. anw it was so cool. their volume significantly increased at the last song haha..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;40&amp;#8217;s performance was by 棒棒糖 (allow me to puke). i mean not at 40 but at 棒棒糖 but nvm. they very funny still have alto and sop one haha..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i&amp;#8217;m starting to think that it might be a good thing that i missed POP last year, bcos when i see 40 busying around, i feel sorry leh. although i&amp;#8217;m not saying that i didnt enjoy them serving us haha.. but it was sad that i missed giving out of presents esp when it was the first time i got so excited about a present that we conceptualised after melrose CIP! or was it habitat for humanity. ok nvm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;anw then they gave presents. i was occupied with reading the message on 42&amp;#8217;s bottle when everyone 起哄 when they saw 42 NCOs&amp;#8217; super big jar!! haha. in the end we figured out that it was NYNPCC batch 39 bcos i got h haha ok nvm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;waiting for 41&amp;#8217;s present was exciting cos they crowd around for very long and duno doing what. then some sqdm saw there was &amp;#8220;wool&amp;#8221; written and we were all wondering what it meant until yanni 发挥 her unexpected skill again and we were all lamed diao haha. sadly, no one realised that it was an ice pop until they said. and the unit likes to play with words haha. ice (pop) lol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;40&amp;#8217;s present was like woah a load of purple thing coming in a trolley and i got a shock haha. we were all wondering why they give us brinjals until they explained the purple icepop brinjal flavoured thing. and we were all lamed out. lol. i think our ice pop skit was too etched into cadets&amp;#8217; minds haha..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;then 36 ma&amp;#8217;ams came up to talk to us. said things about how it will be hard for us to be together (very scary! i think i&amp;#8217;ll be very sad if that happens) when we go hwachong and stuff like that. i&amp;#8217;ll be very sad ok.. ): then they said smth about our POP performance for them (down by the bay!) haha..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;went to thank mr ho for coming, and 36 ma&amp;#8217;ams and 38 ma&amp;#8217;ams. 37 ma&amp;#8217;ams zou le never get to talk to them ): so sad..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;then jieqi&amp;#8217;s jap buddy came! she&amp;#8217;s called rio. then we went for squad talk in the quad all the way till abt 7plus. they totally bao liao everything lor. i cant believe half their squad likes zhiyi the ah pek. weird taste. haha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;then after squad talk there was a cockroach in the quad!!!! omg i cant believe it! there&amp;#8217;s like no food in the quad what!! if it was flying i would have died from fright lol..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;then we went to shower!! shuang man. i think it will be one of the last times we shower in sch le ): after that went upstairs to pack my super fat bag and try to stuff everything in. then went downstairs to buy food cos i only had 2 icecreams cos jomain couldnt finish hers and half the slice of cake 40 gave cos i couldnt finish it haha. in the end only bought green tea and went to quad cos i was sweating like mad even though i just showered. lied down and stared at the stars haha.. then went upstairs..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;almost forgot to pack my shoes in and i had to dig out my skirt cos i forgot to return key!! so dumb. then took bus to jieqi&amp;#8217;s house we ba zhan a lot of space haha.. was hungry at jieqi&amp;#8217;s house so ate a bit of rice. then watched sqdms play wii and i won jiawen in boxing!!! &lt;img src=&#039;http://s.wordpress.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif&#039; alt=&#039;:D&#039; class=&#039;wp-smiley&#039; /&gt; jieqi&amp;#8217;s buddy can play wii very well ok&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;after that got abit bored so yuanhan and i went upstairs to send 41 the email and we threw stuff down to sqdms, like their np jacket and purple aliens lol. i dont wanna talk abt yinhwee&amp;#8217;s alien!!!!!! i&amp;#8217;m so super jealous..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;anw went down to watch enchanted and then we wanted to watch 300 but i was feeling sleepy so i went upstairs. but somehow when i reached 3rd floor i felt wide awake -____- so i went blogging with jinqing on the squad blog haha.. then ju woke up halfway and felt cold so we wanted to give ju deborah&amp;#8217;s blanket cos she had two then deborah grabbed back! so funny lol. then we just gave it to ju anw and deborah complained smth abt she was having such a sweet dream lol. later yinhwee hinted super long that we were being noisy but we ignored her but in the end we gave in at 2am haha..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;went into jieqi&amp;#8217;s jiejies room to sleep. there was like no space lah so i had to sleep on the platform side which is like only 30++cm wide i think so tragic right ): went out to get towel to use as blanket cos very cold! i used purple alien as my pillow and my yellow ice pop as my bolster haha &lt;img src=&#039;http://s.wordpress.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif&#039; alt=&#039;:D&#039; class=&#039;wp-smiley&#039; /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;div class=&#039;snap_preview&#039;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;so I did it, I got my Harry Potter tattoo. and oh what a journey it was&amp;#8230;okay not really. it just seemed like a journey because it took forever. we arrived at the first shop on the north side of town because we wanted this guy named Mikey to do our tats. well it turned out that Mikey no longer works there, he is now running another tattoo shop on the &lt;em&gt;south&lt;/em&gt; side of town. so we sat in traffic for an hour on empty stomachs because we haven&amp;#8217;t eaten since&amp;#8230;oh yeah we didn&amp;#8217;t eat that day. an hour later, we arrived. after talking to Mikey about The Husband&amp;#8217;s geeky organic chemistry themed leg sleeve, Mikey set an appointment for him on Saturday. it&amp;#8217;s going to be an all day ordeal but it&amp;#8217;s going to be SO AWESOME. but anyways, back to my tattoo&amp;#8230;I told him what I wanted and he said that he couldn&amp;#8217;t fit that sentence (&amp;#8221;I believe in Nargles&amp;#8221;) on one foot unless the letters were tiny and he said that he didn&amp;#8217;t want to do tiny letters because after time the lines will bleed in together and it will look like a blob. so he said that if I wanted it on one foot he would design me something where the words would stack on top of each other. so after a few beers at the bar next door I go back to check out his work. it took a little over an hour to do, and it hurt like heck (but as long as I was watching his every move it didn&amp;#8217;t hurt so much), here it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone&quot; src=&quot;http://photos-c.ak.facebook.com/photos-ak-sf2p/v330/102/41/1348494770/n1348494770_65226_2927.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;451&quot; height=&quot;527&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so yeah, my big fat swollen foot. and btw, that is a radish in the middle. I had to explain to my mom that it was not a retarded dwarf carrot&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;div class=&#039;snap_preview&#039;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was chatting with Mama Jo this afternoon and mentioned that sometimes I thought of shutting down this blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to post an entry everyday, until I had to move to Singapore. I had such an appetite for making each entry as creative as possible, like a feature piece, even if I am just writing about mundane things. Ideas usually come while I&#039;m my way home from work. Well, if you had to be stuck in traffic for at least 40 minutes, any idea can come up just to cope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was reading through my old entries, circa 2004/2005. I miss the wittiness and sometimes weirdness, and most importantly, the how much more insightful these old entries are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What has changed? Was it because being away from home took away forced me to divert my energy to do things I never had to do back home (e.g. laundry)? I could not express myself very well, too lazy to write about my feelings/thoughts/observations/insights about many things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I kept my blog because I also want it to be something my friends can read. But I had to change blogs 3, 4 times because I had &quot;stalkers&quot; and made me feel uncomfortable. Between changes, I think most of my original readers have stopped following my blog. I&#039;m not sure who reads my blog now (leave a comment?). There&#039;s facebook and friendster now; for short-attention spans, it&#039;s the perfect way to keep in touch and be updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t know, I think I just can&#039;t get the same satisfaction as before. Or maybe I should just start to do it regularly again, maybe everything will come back?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&#039;http://dougwalk.wordpress.com/2008/08/19/day-79-health-and-fitness/081908s/&#039; title=&#039;081908s&#039;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://dougwalk.files.wordpress.com/2008/08/081908s.jpg?w=128&amp;h=96&quot; width=&quot;128&quot; height=&quot;96&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Yesterday I made a comment to Don Reisinger about corporate honesty and how to get out in front of something before it turns into a big deal, especially if something is wrong. I had to get out in front of my personal appearance and health earlier this year. Starting June 1st, I was 50 pounds overweight and now I weigh nearly 27 pounds less than I did. When I started, even the tying of my shoes was a difficult chore; now not nearly the problem it once was. I was eating way too much, in simple terms I was a glutton. I reduced the amount and in some cases the type of food that I eat and the weight started falling off of me. it was a simple plan of eat less and walk more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So today I can say that I was honest with myself and that is the reason for this blog. Honesty is a precept given to us by the Lord Himself and I wanted to be within His plan when I noticed that I was covering up my dishonesty with bigger clothes and more food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are reading this and wonder. That is my revelation. Be honest with yourself and others in all of your dealings. In your personal life &amp;amp; public life. It&amp;#8217;s always a good policy.&lt;/p&gt;

That is what I feel lately. Carol was ill badly and suffered a long trip from home to England, and, we missed Graduation Ceremony; for me, I have spent quite lots of money to PAY my car’s MOT which expired when I was in China, to PAY my phone bill which cost xxx fucking pounds in this two month time because I used it in China even just for a couple of times, to PAY the extra charge of Virgin of my Internet bill because I did not follow the contract due to I just canceled direct debit, to PAY the charge of our graduated dress for the ceremony although we did not even show up. Trust me, those were a lot of money.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin:0cm 0cm 0pt&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=EN-US&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot; size=2&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;p style=&quot;margin:0cm 0cm 0pt&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=EN-US&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot; color=&quot;#ff0000&quot; size=2&gt;Thank God. Everything just all got better in time. The most important thing is that Carol is fine. Thanks for care by everyone, the medicines from Fang E and Laiying E, also the phone calls from Neil, William and Constance. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin:0cm 0cm 0pt&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=EN-US&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot; size=2&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

Andy, Laiying E and Jason picked us up from London Heathrow with a car they had rented just for us which was very helpful for us because we were both too exhausted to go back Grimsby by our own. Fang E had arranged the place to live and food to eat for us and also she and Erica lent me their car to work when my car wasn’t allowed to drive. Uncle Wah and Tracy E have kept the job for me and took us to have morning tea or dinner sometimes. Bobbihno is always staying with me when I am working and we made fun together so that time has easily been killed. Now, my car’s been done with Andy’s help. And I am working as many as I can to pay for the damages. “It’ll all get better in time.” Many thanks for all them indeed!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin:0cm 0cm 0pt&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=EN-US&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot; size=2&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

I was told by all that Norwich and UEA are both very good to stay. I am looking forward to that. Unfortunately, Norwich City FC is play in Championship but Premier League. I still cannot watch Premier League in my city. But comparing with Grimsby town’s Division 2, Championship is much better. I can even see Sun Jihai and Zhengzhi when Sheffield United and Charlton comes to Norwich. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin:0cm 0cm 0pt&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=EN-US&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot; size=2&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

I spent 38.89 pounds to fill my petrol tank of my car. It was full in the first time of its life in my reign. It is so good to drive without worry of petrol. &lt;span style=&quot;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

<description>&lt;div class=&#039;snap_preview&#039;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Saturday afternoon/early evening, I found myself at a farm in Maryland, far from the nearest Metro stop, for a 3 year old&amp;#8217;s birthday party.  It was quite the interesting party, as most of the people were several years older than me and all had kids!  I was quite happy to leave the kids behind at the end of the evening, as some of them were quite loud.  Although, the party did provide an opportunity to sample some very good Indian food!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-147 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;http://katietravelogue.files.wordpress.com/2008/08/img_3168.jpg?w=300&amp;h=225&quot; alt=&quot;Me at a Farm in Maryland&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;dl class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;

&lt;dt class=&quot;wp-caption-dt&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-149&quot; src=&quot;http://katietravelogue.files.wordpress.com/2008/08/img_3167.jpg?w=300&amp;h=225&quot; alt=&quot;Matt at the Farm&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; /&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;

&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://katietravelogue.files.wordpress.com/2008/08/img_3179.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-148&quot; src=&quot;http://katietravelogue.files.wordpress.com/2008/08/img_3179.jpg?w=300&amp;h=225&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other interesting part of the day is that I was able to travel to the end of a Metro line that I take every day! Each day at 5:30 PM or 6 PM, I ride the orange line in the direction of New Carrollton from my office in Virginia to downtown Washington, D.C.  However, I had never actually been to New Carrollton.  But on Saturday, I finally had the opportunity!  And, once I got there, I saw that New Carrollton was just like any other suburban metro stop. Oh well-at least I can say I have been there!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_150&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://katietravelogue.files.wordpress.com/2008/08/300px-new_carrollton_station.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-150&quot; src=&quot;http://katietravelogue.files.wordpress.com/2008/08/300px-new_carrollton_station.jpg?w=300&amp;h=225&quot; alt=&quot;New Carrollton Metro Station&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;New Carrollton Metro Station&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size=3&gt;So I had to go to the dentist today and have some work done on my teeth.  Not a cleaning, but work done where they needed to numb my mouth.  &lt;/font&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;font size=3&gt;So before they began to do the work, the song playing on the radio in the dentist office was, “So You Had A Bad Day” by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.danielpowter.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Daniel Powter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://c.services.spaces.live.com/CollectionWebService/c.gif?cid=3089735025704038095&amp;page=RSS%3a+Bad+Choice&amp;referrer=&quot; width=&quot;1px&quot; height=&quot;1px&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;position:absolute&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;0px&quot; height=&quot;0px&quot; src=&quot;http://c.live.com/c.gif?NC=31263&amp;NA=1149&amp;PI=73329&amp;RF=&amp;DI=3919&amp;PS=85545&amp;TP=brett1richardson.spaces.live.com&amp;GT1=brett1richardson&quot;&gt;

<description>&lt;div class=&#039;snap_preview&#039;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today the boys had their annual physicals. Of course, they were deemed perfect. But you knew that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;D even braved THREE shots in EACH ARM. To add insult to injury he had to have a vial of blood drawn. Poor kid. I treated him to peanut M &amp;amp; M&amp;#8217;s and he sucked it up. Tears were trailing down his sweet little face, though. Poor punkin. I didn&amp;#8217;t know shots were on the roster or I&amp;#8217;d have drugged him up before the appointment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was so beside himself that he let one raunchy fart loose while he was sitting on my lap in the lab and he didn&amp;#8217;t even giggle. Not even a smile. WHEN THERE WAS A FART! That&amp;#8217;&amp;#8217;s just WRONG. He did survive, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The boys and I were home an hour or so before Bubba, their father arrived for an evening of quality {ahem} bonding time. So the only right thing to do is take the dog for a walk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mind you, this week has been a barrage of issues with the puppy and I&amp;#8217;ve increased the pressure on my mother to do something about it. Today I articulated that I don&amp;#8217;t have time to train the dog. I don&amp;#8217;t have time, when I get home, to wait 20 minutes to see if she calms down before I take her outside. Nope. That only makes the jumping works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I SWEAR TO GOD if she says one more time, &amp;#8216;well the dog doesn&amp;#8217;t jump for me&amp;#8217; I&amp;#8217;m going to beat her to death and make sure she&amp;#8217;s dead by strangling her with the leash. Because the dog does, I see it, and I have to listen to her yell at the dog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So today we walked and poor Hannah did her best to poop. I could see her butt sort of puckering and she was squatting and nothing was coming out. I took her back in the house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, Bubba gleefully pointed out a pile of something on the carpet. It looked like tree bark with some bright red paint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was Hannah poop. With a red balloon or some other kind of rubbery substance. The stupid FREAKIN DOG is eating crap and it&amp;#8217;s blocking her up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Labs are notorious chewers but OH MY GOD I&amp;#8217;m so tired of the poop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then a phone call to my mother. Who re-interated for the thousandth time that it was going to be a little rough until the dog is trained as a service dog. See, my mother is hearing impaired. Not so deaf that you&amp;#8217;d know it upon meeting her. You get the feeling something isn&amp;#8217;t right, but it&amp;#8217;s easy to classify that as low IQ and redneck tendencies. No sireee&amp;#8230;.she&amp;#8217;s deaf, too. A real package.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How long, you ask, will it be &amp;#8216;rough&amp;#8217; while the dog is being trained?? Only a year or two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ONLY A YEAR OR TWO? ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?!?!? The woman is clearly delusional.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>In our last newsletter we shared how Haydee was traveling to Siargao and General Santos doing Pastoral Care after I got back from Europe. What we did not know at that time is that Haydee was pregnant!...

<description>&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;terminal,monaco&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#808080&quot;&gt;&lt;font style=&quot;background-color: #ffffff&quot;&gt;If&amp;#160;you do not believe in yourself then who else will? This is my one billion dollar question. I prefer to be my own number one fan. No one knows me better than how I do know myself. I have been sharing my dreams and wishes with different people who have touched my heart in a number of different ways and for several different reasons. I am not that old, but surely I do not need a rocket scientist&#039;s brain to realise that some&amp;#160;people have always supported me and some have always doubted what I can do. No matter how much people do trust me or do not trust me, there is this one person who has never doubted me and that’s myself!!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;terminal,monaco&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#808080&quot;&gt;&lt;font style=&quot;background-color: #ffffff&quot;&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;terminal,monaco&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#808080&quot;&gt;&lt;font style=&quot;background-color: #ffffff&quot;&gt;I&amp;#160;have always being there for me, I have always believed in my strength, I have always believed in my capabilities. Whether its the footballing amateur skills or a hobby poetry talent or the good results in my education career so far, I &lt;span&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/span&gt;have always visualize myself on the driving seat, surely among those on the front line. I wish to set my own way of life. I wish to be that public icon, making young boys and girls wish to be just like me. I wish to be among the highly ranked fellows in Africa, hopefully Africa and dreamily the whole world. Right now I can barely see how and when but being my own number one fan myself, I can surely see all my dreams come true. I have great respect to some highly rated brains in the world in all aspects. I admire the Nkrumahs, Nyerere, Rabin and Mandela just to name a few in politics. I admire Newton, Eisten and lots more who in all generations have surely let their names penetrate the history book as among the best in their ages and arguably the best of all times.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;terminal,monaco&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#808080&quot;&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;terminal,monaco&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#808080&quot;&gt;&lt;font style=&quot;background-color: #ffffff&quot;&gt;Whats the secret behind most rated and respected people’s success? Is it just GOD’s given talents? Is it their hardworking and determination? Do they have the best of brains? It’s true some things are meant to be, but is it true that only some people can penetrate the history books? I strongly believe its all about self decision. I have my own life theories and somehow &lt;span&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/span&gt;I believe I can be the next “big thing”. What about you dear reader? If you don’t, it’s about time now you do!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;terminal,monaco&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#808080&quot;&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;terminal,monaco&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#808080&quot;&gt;&lt;font style=&quot;background-color: #ffffff&quot;&gt;I look at my education career so far, I compare it with those claimed to be the best ever lived. Its obvious their education is not entirely the reason for their success…then what could be the reason behind their success? I wish I could have a personal conversation with all of them, anyone who have made the world feel he is the best in his/her field. Is real success defined by achievements in sports? If YES is the answer then I wish I could talk to Muhammad Ali or the wheel masters Valentino Rossi and Michael Schumacher. Or is the real success defined by theories of people like Mao Tsetung , Mandela, Desmond Tutu or the late Rabin. Take a moment populate in your mind a list of most talked about people that you know and some you admire. It feels like a miracle to be the next big thing. But I wish to be my own number one fan, I wish to be my own number one supporter who strongly believe in myself and I have that positive feeling deep own in my heart that tells me I have a lot to offer to my society. I might not have the best of brains, but I really feel I am among the best of young African talents around who could spark other brains to change the world and I want to start with you!! I wish to make you see your abilities in different perspective after reading this article of mine!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;terminal,monaco&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#808080&quot;&gt;&lt;font style=&quot;background-color: #ffffff&quot;&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;terminal,monaco&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#808080&quot;&gt;&lt;font style=&quot;background-color: #ffffff&quot;&gt;I wish to let young generations know and follow my theories towards success in education and how I describe academic success. Its difficult to use what I have experienced because I am not that old but I real feel I have a lot to offer through how I visualize the future, my little amateur brain is not bad either in doing analysis and be a critic. In my entire life I have always believed the best type of competition is when you compete against YOURSELF and define success as meeting your own goals and targets. If I could induce this competitive mentality to the youth in Africa and the rest of the world, we could surely make this world a better place to be.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;terminal,monaco&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#808080&quot;&gt;&lt;font style=&quot;background-color: #ffffff&quot;&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Its useless doing something just for the sake of doing. The best way of doing anything is through making efforts to be ranked among the best in your area, and in this globalize world you should start thinking about being the best in the world as well. I have always respected my opponents, in showing no disrespect to my opponents in any competition I have been involved, I have always ignored what my opponents do. I believe if I’ll always be improving its obvious at the end of the day I’ll end up on top. In my dictionary satisfaction is not among the words and being happy with my achievement is my number one enemy.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;terminal,monaco&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#808080&quot;&gt;&lt;font style=&quot;background-color: #ffffff&quot;&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I do not want to be the next them in their ways but I will do anything possible to make a name for myself. I do not want to walk around telling people who I am but I so badly wish to make them wish to know who I am and they should admire my achievements. I wish to make efforts seeing and appreciated, I wish to make my work get recognized and certified as among the best of all times.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;terminal,monaco&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#808080&quot;&gt;&lt;font style=&quot;background-color: #ffffff&quot;&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;terminal,monaco&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#808080&quot;&gt;&lt;font style=&quot;background-color: #ffffff&quot;&gt;How badly I hate to be a looser and I set a personal battle, ambition and a self dream to become one of the best. For now I can not even see myself as among the average best in computer science, but I have a belief in myself. With all these great friends I have, the support from my lovely mother, someone who has never doubted my ability to do and achieve whatever I wish to achieve. Its just the matter of time and this should be the same to you dear reader as well. Just believe in youeself and believe in your strength…YOU CAN DO IT!!!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

<description>&lt;div class=&#039;snap_preview&#039;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had the perfect day today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know it&amp;#8217;s weird coming from me &lt;img src=&#039;http://s.wordpress.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif&#039; alt=&#039;;)&#039; class=&#039;wp-smiley&#039; /&gt; but it&amp;#8217;s really true!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, I got to sleep in. not meaning I set my alarm for past 8am, but I didn&amp;#8217;t set an alarm at all!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;I got up, had breakfast, my friend S. came around and we headed for the lake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;http://i24.photobucket.com/albums/c36/crashed_cocoon/vivirparacontarla/2008-07-31_see.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

We spent most of the day there and then went into town and each had some loverly icecream, S. with fruit and I with chcolate icecream and candied walnuts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;http://i24.photobucket.com/albums/c36/crashed_cocoon/vivirparacontarla/2008-07-31_icecream.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;yummie ice-cream!&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;Later we had a barbecue with my parents and then I headed off for bandpractice =)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is basically what I pictured my summer to be like. Just&amp;#8230; longer than a day *sighs*&lt;/p&gt;

 Monday and up earlier than normal. Yesterday, at church, we had Pastor Jackson Senyonga from  Uganda speaking and leading us in an evening prayer meeting. I played in the morning and the evening and I&amp;#8217;m tired a little as I was wound up when we got home at nearly 10:PM. Still on plan, but didn&amp;#8217;t get to walk yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>    &lt;span style=&quot;color:rgb(0, 112, 192)&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;Why does it hurt so much to do the right thing?  On August 23, 2008 we took my only daughter, and my youngest child to college.  We helped her unpack and make her bed.  We shared a root beer float and then we hugged her and told her goodbye.  She was crying and I was trying so hard not to.  All the way home I talked to her through text messages.  Before we had even gotten home, her only pair of shoes had lost it&#039;s sole.  (I felt like I&#039;d lost my soul.)  The next morning she was crying and missing home and I was crying because she was crying.  I KNOW she is where she should be.  I KNOW it is God&#039;s will she be there.  I KNOW she will make a wonderful teacher or whatever she decides to become.  I KNOW that is the best college for her.  I KNOW God worked it out so that almost $30,000 of the $32,000 yearly fee was covered by scholarships and grants she doesn&#039;t have to pay back.  BUT why couldn&#039;t my daughter have stayed my little girl just a little longer?  Oh, I know, there are parents with special needs children who wish their children could grow up and leave home to go to college.  And I do appreciate that she is not just &quot;normal&quot; but above normal and will be a major success at whatever she chooses to do.  I thank God for this opportunity He has given her.  I thank Him for the wonderful daughter He has allowed me to enjoy for the last 18 years.  I know this is not forever; she will be home for visits and summers too.  I kick myself and remember how we had the option of keeping her in preschool one more year, but we thought she was ready to go to kindergarten.  Had we held her back, I&#039;d have one more year of her in high school and at home.  But it is too late and too futile to second guess ourselves now.  She did grow up and did graduate and now she must move on to the next chapter in her life.  &lt;br&gt;   So every day she and I email and text and call each other.  And every day I send her mail.  And I tell myself she really isn&#039;t all that far away and it really won&#039;t be that long until I see her again.  Then she came home for the weekend.  It was a 3-day weekend for Labor Day.  Her friends were all going on a retreat and she didn&#039;t want to be alone in the dorm.  So she came home.  It was so good to see her on Friday afternoon.  But Friday evening and off and on all day Saturday she&#039;d cry.  She would look at me and cry.  She&#039;d say, &quot;I don&#039;t want to go back.  I don&#039;t like it there.  I don&#039;t feel like I fit in there.  I want to come home.  I want to go to community college near home.&quot;  And she&#039;d cry.  And I&#039;d say, &quot;But you have to go back.  It&#039;s where you are supposed to be.  It&#039;s where God wants you.  It&#039;s paid for.&quot;  And inside my heart was breaking.  Why do I have to keep doing the right thing? the mom thing?  Why can&#039;t I say it is okay, darling, you can stay home with mom forever?  Did you ever read the story of the butterfly trying to escape its cocoon?  How somebody saw it struggling to get out and slit the cocoon and let it out and forever it was swollen and couldn&#039;t fly?  That a butterfly MUST struggle and get out on its own for that is how the fluid is drained from its body and its wings are strengthened so it can fly and reach its full potential.  So I must let her struggle and I must make her fly or she will be forever doomed.  She thinks she is the only one hurting.  She thinks I don&#039;t care or understand.  She is so totally wrong.  It is much harder than giving birth to her was.  I hugged her as she wept by her car and then I went back in the house.  I sat on the steps in the garage and I sobbed and wailed (the Irish blood in me keened) as I saw her car drive out the drive and turn up the gravel road away from home.  I know she was crying too.  I felt her pain too, on top of my own pain.  I don&#039;t want her to leave, any more than she wants to leave, but if she doesn&#039;t she will be stunted for life.  So I do the right thing and push her out of the nest one more time, no matter how much it hurts.  I hope one day she understands and knows just how very much I do love her.  But God, why does it hurt so much to do the right thing?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://c.services.spaces.live.com/CollectionWebService/c.gif?cid=-7607657382615045650&amp;page=RSS%3a+Why+does+it+hurt+so+much+to+do+the+right+thing%3f&amp;referrer=&quot; width=&quot;1px&quot; height=&quot;1px&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;position:absolute&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;0px&quot; height=&quot;0px&quot; src=&quot;http://c.live.com/c.gif?NC=31263&amp;NA=1149&amp;PI=73329&amp;RF=&amp;DI=3919&amp;PS=85545&amp;TP=lingerwithlinda.spaces.live.com&amp;GT1=lingerwithlinda&quot;&gt;

<description>&lt;div class=&#039;snap_preview&#039;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last Saturday, my maid of honor Beth, my matron of honor Monica, and Ryan&#039;s mom Lettie and sister Katie threw us a fantastic wedding shower. It was held at Pal Joey&#039;s in West Chicago, which has my favorite pizza and was a cool space to have a shower in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Katie and Lettie were up most of the night before making all kinds of fun things for the shower, like this &quot;cake&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_102&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; style=&quot;width: 235px&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-102&quot; src=&quot;http://lisaann11.files.wordpress.com/2008/08/cake-and-stuff.jpg?w=225&amp;h=300&quot; alt=&quot;Cakes, cup and otherwise&quot; width=&quot;225&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Cakes, cup and otherwise&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cake is actually white towels, and the flowers are soap. They also made the bride and groom on top- the groom is holding records, and the bride is knitting. &lt;img src=&#039;http://s.wordpress.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif&#039; alt=&#039;:-)&#039; class=&#039;wp-smiley&#039; /&gt; Katie also made the cupcakes, which were amazing and got rave reviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were lots of fun people there:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-103&quot; src=&quot;http://lisaann11.files.wordpress.com/2008/08/shower-peeps.jpg?w=300&amp;h=225&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Not the best picture of Katie…sorry Katie!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And they were very generous and gave us lots of fun stuff:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-106&quot; src=&quot;http://lisaann11.files.wordpress.com/2008/08/the-loot1.jpg?w=225&amp;h=300&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;225&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beth got everyone mingling with some creative games, including a &quot;how well do you know them?&quot; quiz about me and Ryan. Here we are discussing the answers (we disagreed on just a few of them):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-107&quot; src=&quot;http://lisaann11.files.wordpress.com/2008/08/shower-games.jpg?w=300&amp;h=225&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We opened our fabulous gifts, and then I almost dropped the cake:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-108&quot; src=&quot;http://lisaann11.files.wordpress.com/2008/08/dropping-the-cake.jpg?w=300&amp;h=225&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we saved it just in time and there was no permanent damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After we got everyone loaded up on sugar, people started heading home, but not before we got this picture of me and my siblings:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_109&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-109&quot; src=&quot;http://lisaann11.files.wordpress.com/2008/08/me-and-my-sibs.jpg?w=300&amp;h=225&quot; alt=&quot;Colleen, me, Kelly and Scott&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Colleen, me, Kelly and Scott&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They and my mom made the trip from Iowa for the shower, and I&#039;m really grateful they were there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, it was a great time. The only hard part was wanting to spend a lot more time talking with people than we were able to, but from what I hear that&#039;s what the wedding will be like so I suppose this was good practice. It was so great to be with friends and family who had gathered to celebrate with us, and made me look forward even more to the wedding!&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;div class=&#039;snap_preview&#039;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I remember, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I usually have a problem with the trend in the last few years to memorilize everything.  Seriously, if I took a tragic shit, I think that I might get a plaque somewhere.  While I don&#039;t think that we should forget history and the lessons learned from it, I&#039;m not sure that every.damn.thing needs to be memorialized forevermore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, today is the seventh anniversary of September 11.  While rolling my eyes at all the mentions of it, I have also been moved to read the stories on the blogs I read about where people were, and how that&#039;s affected them.  It got me to thinking about where I was seven years ago, and how far I have come, and how much our country has changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On September 11, 2001, I was at work at Prudential, and one of the women in my department, Karen Q, stood up and said to all of us &quot;A plane just hit the World Trade Center.&quot;  I looked over at her and said, &quot;Someone is losing their job today!&quot;  It never occurred to any of us that it was anything but an accident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few minutes later, someone else stood up and said the second tower had been hit.  And we started hearing about planes crashing in the Pentagon, and heading toward the White House.  We had a TV in the conference room, and I sent my temp in there to see if we could get any reception.  I was IMing the guy I was dating, and he was able to get on the CNN website, and was giving me updates. When I heard that planes were heading toward Washington, I called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.airynothing.com&quot;&gt;Barb &lt;/a&gt;to see if she was safe.  She was at work at Goddard (NASA), and told me that she honestly didn&#039;t know where she was safter - at her apartment inside the Beltway, or at Goddard, which is close to Andrews AFB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sean, the temp, got reception, and we all took turns going into the conference room to watch what was going on.  (I was attached to a call center, and we had not officially closed, although there was nothing going on.)  I was watching when the Towers went down, and was amazed that I was the only person in the room crying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We closed shortly after that - corporate thought that they might be in danger in Newark*, and shut down the entire company.  My friends&#039; works were not closing down, so I offered to make a big pot of spaghetti and have everyone over to watch the news and the press conference that night.  The guy I was dating came over for a while, but then left before the rest of the crowd showed up.  Everyone trickled in as they got out of work, and we ate and watched the news.  We eventually just couldn&#039;t take anymore, turned the TV off, and started drinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We missed the press conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few of us were standing out on the front steps smoking later that night, after it was dark.  We heard planes going overhead (I lived right by the St. Paul Airport), and thought nothing of it until Nick mentioned, &quot;Hey, isn&#039;t all air travel suspended?&quot;  Well, yes it was.  We later learned that relatives of the Saudi royal family were being flown out through St. Paul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with most big news events, I got too overwhelmed after a couple of days, and had to stop listening to the news.  I just couldn&#039;t handle the sadness and anger and despair of the rest of the world.  I know that there are a lot of stories that I missed, and a lot of both heartwarming and terrible moments that I don&#039;t know about.  I&#039;m ok with that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ve become disheartened over the last seven years at how September 11 has been used as a scapegoat for all of our ills as a society.  I am embarrassed at how our country has persisted in pursuing the War on Terror, which really seems to be an excuse to exert government control over Americans and force other countries into doing things &quot;our way&quot;.  We have seen wars started over false information, have seen our civil rights disappear, and have re-elected (or elected for the first time) a man that can only be described as a nincompoop so that we can continue these fine programs.  I&#039;m sad that the lives of these 2,973 people are now standing as symbols of the beginning of the movement by our government to make us &quot;safer&quot; when we are no safer than we were before - just more constricted, and more afraid than ever before.  I&#039;m angry that our politicians and members of the community have decided that these attacks were the result of our citizens straying from god, fucking who they love, and our increasing materialistic nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my mind, the attacks of September 11 were the works of a madman that hates America and had the means to make a really big statement about it.  He, like all cult leaders, was able to talk other people into doing his bidding.  I don&#039;t know whether he - or anyone else - will attack us again, but I am pretty sure that our citizenry is no safter because we can&#039;t bring liquids or knitting needles on the planes.  I do think that our fearless leader used this event to make changes that he wanted to in order to make himself more powerful, and settle a personal vendetta.  Watching the fallout from Sepetember 11 makes me ashamed to be an American.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I choose to remember today are 2,973 people that woke up one morning and went about their business, never dreaming that they would be part of the biggest social and political statement of all time.  I send my love and wishes for peace to their loved ones, and hope that seven years has helped ease their pain, just a little bit.  This is not the day to remember the act of one crazy man, but to honor the lives that were taken on this day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*In December, 2000, I made my only trip to Newark for work - it was my second day at Prudential, and I had to travel with all my co-workers.  Being direction-impaired, and having not looked at a map before we left, I didn&#039;t realize where Newark is.  I looked out the plane window as we landed and thought to myself, &quot;Hey, that looks like the World Trade Center.  &lt;em&gt;Holy shit, that&#039;s the World Trade Center!&lt;/em&gt;&quot;  I&#039;d never been to New York (still haven&#039;t, if anyone is up for travel) and was so excited to be able to see into NYC.  It was a total fluke that I got to see the Towers at all, and I&#039;m grateful for that fluke, as I am for many other flukes in my life.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;div class=&#039;snap_preview&#039;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;My mom came up to visit and to take me out of the house for a while and watch the baby while B and I went out on a date this weekend. Everything went peachy- the baby was great, sleeping most of the time we were away so I didn&amp;#8217;t feel too guilty about leaving baby B at home. However, yesterday we (my mom, the baby and I) went to the rink to watch B&amp;#8217;s hockey game. Game was great, but as we pull;ed into the parking lot the Saturn started to shiver and felt like it was dying. When we came out and got everyone into the car, it wouldn&amp;#8217;t start. B hitched a ride down to his parents house and borrowed the Toyota so that we could drive home, and we left the Saturn parked at the rink, wondering when we would actually be able to afford having it fixed, and realizing that now, since the van finally kicked the bucket, without borrowing the Toyota we would be car-less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suggested staying home from our movie last night, since we could afford a movie, but not hundreds in car repairs, but my mom insisted that we go out anyway, so we did, driving the Toyota. We got home around midnight and everyone pretty much crashed for the evening. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This morning, as my mom was going out to load up her car to go home, she came back into the apartment and asked me where we had parked. I said right in front of the apartment, but remember, we drove the Toyota( assuming that she was looking for the Saturn). She said it wasn&amp;#8217;t there and I thought, certainly she must be looking in the wrong place, for the wrong car. I looked outside and there was no Toyota,so I rushed in to wake B up to tell him the car was missing. I was assuming that it had been stolen, but after he woke up with a stream of expletives, he reminded me that there was no parking tag in it, so it was probably towed. This led to me hunting down all of our lease copies looking for a tow company number while B called the emergency maintenance number to find out what company and phone number to call. We finally hunted down the right company with the right car, and it is costing $105 bucks cash to get the car out. Thankfully, my mom had $110 cash in her pocket(what are the chances of that?- I never carry cash, and if I happen to have some it&amp;#8217;s always less than $100 bucks at at time, for fear I might lose it somewhere), and she drove B down to pick the car up from the lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So- we will have the Toyota back for now, while B&amp;#8217;s parents are out of town, until we can get the Saturn fixed- though we still can&amp;#8217;t afford that, and if it wasn&amp;#8217;t for my mom, the Toyota would still be sitting on the tow lot. I told B that this is all a test of our ability to cope as new parents- first tornadoes and no power or AC for the first two days home from the hospital with a newborn baby and a wife recovering from a c-section. Now no transportation and no money- I felt relieved that I was so familiar with the public bus system- if my mom hadn&amp;#8217;t been here to rescue us, once we had the money, I could easily have gotten us from the rink to the apartment, as well as from our apartment to the towing lot to pick up the car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://wonderlost.files.wordpress.com/2008/07/baby-pout-web.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-55&quot; src=&quot;http://wonderlost.files.wordpress.com/2008/07/baby-pout-web.jpg?w=182&amp;#038;h=288&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;182&quot; height=&quot;288&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://wonderlost.files.wordpress.com/2008/07/baby-pout-web.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This is how we feel about financial and transportation difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least it wasn&amp;#8217;t stolen.&lt;/p&gt;
